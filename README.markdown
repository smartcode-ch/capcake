# capcake smartcode flavored

This fork is intended to work with a customised [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/) application layout, where [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/) iteself is a ``git submodule``.

Compared to the original [capcake](https://github.com/jadb/capcake) code, the deployment works under the assumption, that your whole project (and not just the ``app`` folder) is under version control.
